    ## Description
    
    This is my README generator and this README file was created using it.

    - My motivation was based in the fact that I normally don't make a good README file
    - I build this project because I wanted to get a better understanding of README files and to get a little bit better ar node.js and javascript
    - It solves the need of hard typing README files, so it makes it a lot more easy 
    - I learnt how to make quality READMEs and a better understanding of 'inquirer' and the file system as well
